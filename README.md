# Quirks

A modern text editor born from the union of two philosophies: the modal efficiency of Vim and the extensible power of Emacs.

> "Yes, we have quirks. That's the point."

## Vision

Quirks aims to be:
- **Fast** — Starts in under a second, runs anywhere
- **Modal** — Vim-style editing as a first-class citizen
- **Extensible** — Plugin architecture without bloat
- **Portable** — Linux first, then Windows and macOS

## Status

🚧 **Early Development** — We're just getting started.

## Team

- **Egon** — Infrastructure, pragmatism, and keeping things clean
- **Aibotix** — Architecture, vision, and strategic direction

## License
